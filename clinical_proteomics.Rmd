### Proteomics using MS-DAP
The samples were all prepared and analysed within the same batch and then analysed with DIA-NN.

# 5) Optionally, describe a statistical contrast; in this example we compare sample groups "WT" and "KO".
# - You should use exact same labels as "group" column in sample metadata table.
# - If you don't want to do stats, simply remove or comment this line (e.g. just look at QC report, or maybe your dataset has 1 experimental group only).
# - example for multiple contrasts; dataset = setup_contrasts(dataset, contrast_list = list( c("control", "condition_a"),  c("control", "condition_b")  ) )
# - example for adding random variables to eBayes/DEqMS/MSqRob regressions to i.e. counter batch effects (note; these variables must be column names present in sample metadata table. double-check with; print(dataset$samples,n=Inf)): dataset = setup_contrasts(dataset, contrast_list = list(  c("WT","KO")  ), random_variables = c("induction", "batch") )

# 6) Main function that runs the entire pipeline
# for DIA, recommended settings are defined below, selecting only peptides that were confidently detected in most samples
# for DDA, 'confident detection' relies on MS/MS which may be more rare (relying on match-between-runs instead)
# following benchmarks in the MS-DAP manuscript, for DDA we recommend to set no or minimal requirements on 'detect' parameters; "filter_fraction_detect = 0" and "filter_min_detect = 0" (or 1 if you want at least 1 MS/MS detect per peptide per sample group)
dataset = analysis_quickstart(
  dataset,
  filter_min_detect = 3,         # each peptide must have a good confidence score in at least N samples per group
  filter_min_quant = 3,          # similarly, the number of reps where the peptide must have a quantitative value
  filter_fraction_detect = 0.75, # each peptide must have a good confidence score in at least 75% of samples per group
  filter_fraction_quant = 0.75,  # analogous for quantitative values
  filter_by_contrast = TRUE,     # only relevant if dataset has 3+ groups. For DEA at each contrast, filters and normalization are applied on the subset of relevant samples within the contrast for efficiency, see further MS-DAP manuscript. Set to FALSE to disable and use traditional "global filtering" (filters are applied to all sample groups, same data table used in all statistics)
  norm_algorithm = c("vsn", "modebetween_protein"), # normalization; first vsn, then modebetween on protein-level (applied sequentially so the MS-DAP modebetween algorithm corrects scaling/balance between-sample-groups)
  dea_algorithm = c("deqms", "msempire", "msqrob"), # statistics; apply multiple methods in parallel/independently
  dea_qvalue_threshold = 0.01,                      # threshold for significance of adjusted p-values in figures and output tables
  dea_log2foldchange_threshold = NA,                # threshold for significance of log2 foldchanges. 0 = disable, NA = automatically infer through bootstrapping
  output_qc_report = TRUE,                          # optionally, set to FALSE to skip the creation of the QC report (not recommended for first-time use)
  output_abundance_tables = TRUE,                   # optionally, disable the creation of abundance table output files
  output_dir = "msdap_results",                    # output directory, here set to "msdap_results" within your working directory. Alternatively provide a full path, eg; output_dir="C:/path/to/myproject",
  output_within_timestamped_subdirectory = TRUE
  )
# print a short summary of results at the end
print_dataset_summary(dataset)

# 7) All done! Check out the generated files in the output directory, starting with report.pdf
